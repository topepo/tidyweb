# The tidyverse

## Components

```{r, echo = FALSE}
pkgs <- sort(c("haven", "stringr", "forcats", "readr", "ggplot2", "tidyr", "purrr"))
home <- paste0("http://", pkgs, ".tidyverse.org")

imgs <- paste0(
  "<a href='", home, "'>",
  "<img src='", home, "/logo.png' width='120' height='139' /></a>"
)

div <- paste0("<div>", paste(imgs, collapse = ""), "</div>")
knitr::asis_output(div)
```

The tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share common philosophies and are designed to work together. This site is a work-in-progress guide to the tidyverse and its packages.

If you are new to the tidyverse, the best place to learn the complete philsophy and how everything fits together is the [R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book. This book is available for free online, and can you order a physical copy from [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2aHLAQ1) (currently taking pre-orders, the book should be out by the end of the year).

## Installation

Install the complete tidyverse with a single line of code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Load the __core__ tidyverse packages: ggplot2, tibble, tidyr, [readr](http://readr.tidyverse.org), purrr, and dplyr. These are the packages you are likely to use in almost every analyis.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
